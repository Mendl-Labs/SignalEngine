# Rebalancer crates

`reference-rules`, `broker-adapters`, `fake-broker`, `mandate-core`, `rebalancer-core`,
`rebalancer-risk`, `rebalancer-run` are the MVP rebalancer. They are deliberately isolated from
`crates/executionhandler` and `crates/hostbuilder` (and every other pre-existing crate in this
workspace) — no dependency, import, or reference in either direction. `executionhandler` and
`hostbuilder` carry known live-trading bugs (a broken Kraken nonce, tenant-blind credential
loading) that this rebalancer must not inherit.

Moved here from a standalone local repo (`C:\Users\ikenn\Projects\rebalancer`) on 2026-09-22. The
code was already built and tested there (740+ tests, clippy clean) before the move; this was a
relocation, not new development. See
`C:\Users\ikenn\Projects\product-mandate\IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the design.
